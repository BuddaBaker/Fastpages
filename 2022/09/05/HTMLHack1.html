<h1 id="html-hacks">“HTML Hacks”</h1>
<p>1. Findings from theme change:
- The theme I used was the hacker theme. It made the entire site black with green text. Overall the coloring of the theme looks nice
however the pages are not visible. On top of that the posts looks a lot worse as it is displayed as text.</p>
