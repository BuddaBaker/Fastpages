<p>The results and grading corresponded with mine. As there are more projects I am able to understand the criteria that collegeboard expects better and I am able to correctly judge whether or not something is deserving of points. Overall this CPT project has some good elements but the list and code is where they missed many points because of how incomplete it was and how they forget to mention certain neccessary parts.</p>

<p>There was only one discrepancy between the score I gave to the project and the score that College Board gave it to. It came from the data abstraction portion where I thought the list wasn't being stored correctly. Collegeboard believed that it was being stored correctly.</p>

<p>My results were very similiar to collegeboard however the only difference between them is Testing. I gave the points to the Testing portion because it had all the calls that were needed to gain the points however, Collegeboard believes that the Testing doesn't fit the criteria needed to gain the points.</p>

<p>My scoring is the same as the college board scoring. This submission was easy to see how it worked and easy to score because of the simplicity it had. My grading overall is improving because I can now correctly grade the entire project which is something that I have definetly improved upon.</p>
