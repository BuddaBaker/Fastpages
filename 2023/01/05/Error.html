<p>The issue I had with my website was that it wouldn't run locally. The error was:
In Gemfile:
  github-pages was resolved to 214, which depends on
    github-pages-health-check was resolved to 1.17.0, which depends on
      dnsruby was resolved to 1.61.5, which depends on
        simpleidn was resolved to 0.2.1, which depends on
          unf was resolved to 0.1.4, which depends on
            unf_ext</p>
<p>I tried to restart the process in order to fix and I also tried searching online for the error to see if there were any solutions. The website I went to was stackoverflow which was not able to fix it. Here is the link to the website I used: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67617616/error-when-running-the-command-bundler-install">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67617616/error-when-running-the-command-bundler-install</a>.</p>
