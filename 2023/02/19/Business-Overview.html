    <p>Elevator Pitch: Many people have issues with time management about 82% of americans. To fix this I created OTASCA which is an app that creates a schedule for the people and allows them to manage their time better. This app not only plans your important meetings but also schedules work time and other important activities you have going on.</p>

<p>Business Model: My business will be a monthly subscription service charging $5 a month for the basic features and an additional price for the premium features.</p>

<p>Next Steps: The next steps are to create a survey to see if there is interest in the idea and how much the consumers would be willing to pay for this.</p>
