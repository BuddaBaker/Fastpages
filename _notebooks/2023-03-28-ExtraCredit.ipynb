    "# Final Thoughts\n",
    "Cal State San Marcos would be a great fit for me as a college student. I love to learn more and do research, which is possible at CSUSM because of how many research oppurtunities there are. Furthermore it seems to be a tight knit community, because of what was described in the presentation. A great atmosphere is something I look for in choosing a college because college life is a very imporatant factor. Furthermore there seems to be many like minded people at the school who would be willing to work hard in order to achieve a goal. This helps in building connections that I will have for the future, as both professors and students at the school would be good connections to build. For these reasons and based on the presentation, I will be applying to CSUSM when I am a senior. "
