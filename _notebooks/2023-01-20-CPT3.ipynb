    "The results and grading corresponded with mine. As there are more projects I am able to understand the criteria that collegeboard expects better and I am able to correctly judge whether or not something is deserving of points. Overall this CPT project has some good elements but the list and code is where they missed many points because of how incomplete it was and how they forget to mention certain neccessary parts. "
